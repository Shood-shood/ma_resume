# My Resume Project #

This is my personal resume project built using ChatGPT, VS Code, and deployed to GitHub Pages and Azure for enhanced reliability. This project showcases the skills and technologies I have learned and utilized throughout the development process.
Technologies & Tools Used

# Technologies & Tools Used #
ChatGPT: Utilized ChatGPT to generate code for the index.html page and the associated CSS, leveraging its capability to understand prompts and generate responsive code.
VS Code: Used as the primary development environment for writing and editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. VS Code provided an efficient workspace with extensions that enhanced my coding experience.
Git: Implemented version control using Git, enabling easy tracking of changes and collaboration. The code is stored locally, and I push updates to GitHub to maintain a version history.
GitHub Pages: Deployed the static website to GitHub Pages for quick and accessible hosting of my resume.
Azure Web Apps: Deployed the application to Azure Web Apps, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance. This showcases my understanding of Azure's cloud platform.

# Project Workflow #
Code Development: The core structure and styling of the resume were generated with the help of ChatGPT, where I provided specific prompts to guide the AI in creating the necessary HTML and CSS files.
Version Control: I used Git to track all code changes and pushed the local repository to GitHub for version management and collaboration.
Deployment: The resume is hosted on both GitHub Pages and Azure Web Apps. GitHub Pages was used for quick access and simple hosting, while Azure provides a more reliable and scalable environment.
Reliability: The project is deployed on both platforms to ensure continuous access and reliability, utilizing Azureâ€™s cloud infrastructure for high availability.
